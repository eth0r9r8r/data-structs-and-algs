# DSA Course Assigments
A collection of my assignment submissions for a data structures and algorithms class that I took at the University of Calgary.
For each assignment, I have also included the feedback that I recieved.

## Assigment Explanations
I would like to provide the original assignment handouts for context, but I no longer have access to them.
Instead, I've provided a brief description of each assignment below.

### Assignment 1
For assignment 1 we were provided with various array sorting algorithms, and tasked with creating a short program for testing
them. The focus of this assigment was on our analysis rather than the code itself.

### Assignment 2
For assignment 2 we were tasked with creating a program that reads a list of words from a text file, and writes a new
text file in which all input words that are anagrams of each other are written to the same line. In our implementations, we were 
required to create and use linked list and array data structures, and insertion sort and quick sort algorithms.
We were also required to time our programs and write a short analysis of our program's time complexity.

### Assignment 4
The third assignment tasked us with writing a program that finds paths between two queried nodes in a graph. For the base
assignment we were required to implement depth first search and breadth first search methods. For bonus marks, we could
optionally include an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding paths in a weighted map.

### Assignment 5
For the fourth assignment, the task was to implement a hash map and hashing algorithm. In the base assignment, we used linear
probing for collision resolution. For bonus marks, we could provide an option to use quadratic probing to handle collisions.
