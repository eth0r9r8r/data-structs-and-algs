I have done the bonus part. output1.txt, output2.txt, and output3.txt where generated using
inputDijkstra1.txt and queryDijkstra.txt

To compile simply place all java files and input/query files into an empty directory, then:
- Navigate to the directory within command prompt.
- Type "javac *.java" and press enter.
- Type "java Assign4" and press enter.
- Follow directions in usage message to properly execute program.
